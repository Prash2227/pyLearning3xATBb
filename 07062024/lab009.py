#Task1
# 1.Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# 2.What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# 3.What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

1. '=' ==> work as an assignment operator. It assign to the variable

'==' ==> work as a equal to operator. It returns true if the values are equal on left and right side or false return otherwis.

2. '**' ==> work as an arithmatic operator in python often used for exponentiation.(it's a power operator that raises the number on left to the power of the number on its right')

3. '^'  ==> The ^ operator does a binary xor. a ^ b will return a value with only the bits set in a or in b but not both.
