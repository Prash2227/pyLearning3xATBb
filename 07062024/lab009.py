#Task1
# 1.Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

1. '=' ==> work as an assignment operator. It assign to the variable

'==' ==> work as a equal to operator. It returns true if the values are equal on left and right side or false return otherwis.

# 2.What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

2. '**' ==> work as an arithmatic operator in python often used for exponentiation.(it's a power operator that raises the number on left to the power of the number on its right')


# 3.What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

3. '^'  ==> The ^ operator does a binary xor. a ^ b will return a value with only the bits set in a or in b but not both.



# Task2
# 1. Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8

print(10 ** 2)
# or

r = pow(8, 3)
print(r)

# 2. Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.


x = 20
y = 20

print("x is greater than y" if x >= y else "x is small")
